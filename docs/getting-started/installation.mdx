# Installation

:::info Try It First
Want to test out sqlfmt on a query before you install it? Go to [**sqlfmt.com**](https://sqlfmt.com) to use the interactive, web-based version.
:::

sqlfmt is a command-line tool that is built in Python and runs on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
If you have Python installed and are familiar with installing packages, installation is as
easy as:

```bash
pip install shandy-sqlfmt[jinjafmt]
```
:::tip
Depending on your shell and OS, you may need single or double quotes around `shandy-sqlfmt[jinjafmt]`
:::

For more info and tips, read on.

## Prerequisites

:::info Docker Image Available
If you don't want to install Python, you can run sqlfmt in a container. See [this page](./using-docker) for more info.
:::

You will need Python 3.7+ installed. You should use `pipx` or install into a virtual environment (maybe as a dev-dependency in your project). If you do not know how to install Python and use `pipx` and/or virtual environments, go read about that first.

## Install Using pipx (recommended)

We recommend installing sqlfmt with the [jinjafmt extra](./formatting-jinja.md) (which will also install the Python code formatter, *Black*):

```bash
pipx install shandy-sqlfmt[jinjafmt]
```

But if you would prefer that we leave your jinja alone (or you'd like a lighter-weight install), you can install without the extra:
```bash
pipx install shandy-sqlfmt
```


## Other Installation Options

You should use a virtual environment to isolate sqlfmt's dependencies from others on your system. As part of a larger Python project (like a dbt project), you should probably use a package manager like Poetry or pipenv.
