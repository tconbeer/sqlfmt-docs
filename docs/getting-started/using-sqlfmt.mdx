# Using sqlfmt

:::danger Before You Begin
**sqlfmt is an alpha product** and will not always produce the formatted output you might want. It might even break your SQL syntax. 

It is **highly recommended** to only run sqlfmt on files in a version control system (like git), so that it is easy for you to revert any changes made by sqlfmt. On your first run, be sure to make a commit before running sqlfmt.

sqlfmt is a command-line tool. It works on any posix terminal and on Windows Powershell. If you have used the Python code formatter *Black*, the sqlfmt commands will look familiar. 

:::tip
The code snippets below are commands that can be typed into your terminal, after installing sqlfmt.
:::

To list commands and options:

```bash
sqlfmt --help
```

If you want to format all `.sql` and `.sql.jinja` files in your current working directory (and all nested directories), simply type:
```bash
sqlfmt .
```
You can also supply a path to a one or more files or directories as arguments:
```bash
sqlfmt /path/to/my/dir /path/to/a/file.sql
```
If you don't want to format the files you have on disk, you can run sqlfmt with the `--check` option. sqlfmt will exit with code 1 if the files on disk are not properly formatted:
```bash
sqlfmt --check .
sqlfmt --check path/to/my/dir
```
If you want to print a diff of changes that sqlfmt would make to format a file (but not update the file on disk), you can use the `--diff` option. `--diff` also exits with 1 on changes:
```bash
sqlfmt --diff .
```

sqlfmt can also format code passed through standard input (`stdin`) by passing `-` as the files argument. The formatted code will be output to `stdout` (all other output from sqlfmt is routed to `stderr`):
```bash
echo "select 1" | sqlfmt -
```

<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

sqlfmt is also available as a Dockerized container. This allows for formatting without having Python installed. 

To format the files in the current directory and it's subdirectory:

```bash
docker run \
    -v $(pwd):/src \
    ghcr.io/tconbeer/sqlfmt:latest
```

In this example `$(pwd)` will return the current working directory. All files in this directory will be mounted to the `/src` folder in the container, which by default will be formatted when the container is run.

To format specific files multiple mounts can be passed to the container.

```bash
docker run 
    -v {path to file one}:/src/file_one 
    -v {path to file two}:/src/file_two
    ghcr.io/tconbeer/sqlfmt:latest
```

Or alternatively this can be achieved by passing multiple filenames to `sqlfmt` in the container:

```bash
docker run \
    -v $(pwd):/src \
    ghcr.io/tconbeer/sqlfmt:latest \
    sqlfmt ./file_one ./file_two
```

In the same fashion the `check` and `diff` functionality of `sqlfmt` can be used:

```bash
docker run \
    -v $(pwd):/src \
    ghcr.io/tconbeer/sqlfmt:latest \
    sqlfmt . --check
```

Configurations can be passed along in all the ways described in [configuring sqlfmt](./configuring-sqlfmt.md). The only difference is that environmental configuration can be passed as such:

```bash
docker run \
    -v $(pwd):/src \
    -e SQLFMT_LINE_LENGTH=100 \
    ghcr.io/tconbeer/sqlfmt:latest
```
